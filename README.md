OXID eShop AWS S3 component
===========================

This component is developed to make a communication with AWS S3, such as putting an object, 
removing it, and other operations.

One of the features that we have provided in this component is the ability to store and manage 
the shop images in AWS S3 buckets.
In fact, after installing this component, shop images (products, promotions, vendors, and manufacturers) will 
be stored and managed in cloud storage.

## Installation

1- Run the following command to install the component:

```bash
composer require oxid-esales/aws-s3-component:*
```

2- Set the AWS credentials in `<oxid-eshop-root-directory>/var/configuration/configurable_services.yaml`.

```bash
parameters:
  aws.s3.key: sample-key
  aws.s3.secret: sample-secret
  aws.s3.region: sample-region
  aws.s3.version: sample-version
  aws.s3.image.bucket: sample-image.bucket
  aws.s3.image.bucket.acl: sample-image.bucket.acl
```

## How to install component for development?

Checkout component besides OXID eShop `source` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OXID-eSales/aws-s3-component.git
```

composer require --dev oxid-esales/aws-s3-component:*
```

## How to run tests?

in `<oxid-eshop-root-directory>/var/configuration/configurable_services.yaml`.

2- To run tests for the component please define OXID eShop bootstrap file:

```

## How to generate image variants when using Amazon S3?

OXID eShop generates image size variants (thumbnails,small images, etc) from the "master" images on request.
This functionality is available only for the images accessed via server's storage (not via external CDN).

One of many available solutions is to configure you CDN of choice (e.g. Amazon CloudFront) 
for automatic images resizing (using AWS Lambda@Edge).

After doing this you will need to upload only main "master" images to the external storage (AWS S3),
and the rest of image variants will be generated by external servers (Amazon CloudFront) on the fly
(you will need to pass your resized image requirements (for OXID eShop they are embedded in image URL)
to the AWS by adding a simple Lambda function).
You can find more about CloudFront and Lambda@Edge in the corresponding section of
[AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/resizing-images-with-amazon-cloudfront-lambdaedge-aws-cdn-blog/)
